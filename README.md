## irAE-GPT: Leveraging large language models to identify immune-related adverse events in electronic health records and clinical trial datasets
 
- **irAE-GPT** is a holistic system that leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT models, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o, for identifying immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in clinical text
- The data was collected from two large electronic health record (EHR) systems and from seven clinical trials
- The study population included patients who received any of the following immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies, either as monotherapy or in combination regimens: atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab
- As patients may experience none, one, or multiple irAEs following ICI exposure, irAE-GPT was designed as a multi-label classifier such that it can identify any combination of irAEs associated with each patient
